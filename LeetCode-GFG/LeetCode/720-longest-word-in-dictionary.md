<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/">720. Longest Word in Dictionary</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array of strings <code>words</code> representing an English Dictionary, return <em>the longest word in</em> <code>words</code> <em>that can be built one character at a time by other words in</em> <code>words</code>.</p>

<p>If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
<strong>Output:</strong> "world"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
<strong>Output:</strong> "apple"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 30</code></li>
	<li><code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

        return res
    
    
    
# Time: O(n log(n))   # for sorting the words
# Space: O(n)         # for making the set visited
