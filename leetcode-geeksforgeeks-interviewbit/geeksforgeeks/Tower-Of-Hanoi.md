# Tower Of Hanoi
## Medium 
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">tower of Hanoi</a></span> <span style="font-size:18px">is a famous puzzle where we have three rods and <strong>N</strong> disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod. You are given the number of discs <strong>N</strong>. Initially, these discs are in the rod 1. You need to print all the steps of discs movement so that all the discs reach the 3<sup>rd</sup> rod. Also, you need to find the total moves.<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>The discs are arranged such that the<strong> top disc is numbered 1 </strong>and the<strong> bottom-most disc is numbered N</strong>. Also, all the discs have <strong>different sizes</strong> and a bigger disc <strong>cannot</strong> be put on the top of a smaller disc. Refer the provided link to get a better clarity about the puzzle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>N = 2
<strong>Output:
</strong>move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 3
3<strong>
Explanation: </strong>For N=2&nbsp;, steps will be
as follows in the example and total
3 steps will be taken.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>N = 3
<strong>Output:
</strong>move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 1 from rod 3 to rod 2
move disk 3 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 1
move disk 2 from rod 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
7<strong>
Explanation: </strong>For N=3 , steps will be
as follows in the example and total
7 steps will be taken.</span>
</pre>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Your Task:</span></strong><br>
<span style="font-size:18px">You don't need to read input or print anything. You only need to complete the function <strong>toh()</strong> that takes following parameters: <strong>N</strong> (number of discs),&nbsp;<strong>from</strong> (The rod number from which we move the disc), <strong>to</strong> (The rod number to which we move the disc),&nbsp;<strong>aux</strong> (The rod that is used as an auxiliary rod)&nbsp;and prints the required moves inside function body (See the example for the format of the output) as well as return the count of total moves made.&nbsp;The total number of moves are printed by the driver code.<br>
<strong>Please take care of the case of the letters.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Expected Time Complexity:&nbsp;</strong>O(2<sup>N</sup>).<br>
<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:&nbsp;</strong>O(N).</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Constraints:</span></strong><br>
<span style="font-size:18px">1 &lt;= N &lt;= 16</span></p>
