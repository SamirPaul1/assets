<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/">200. Number of Islands</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which represents a map of <code>'1'</code>s (land) and <code>'0'</code>s (water), return <em>the number of islands</em>.</p>

<p>An <strong>island</strong> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 300</code></li>
	<li><code>grid[i][j]</code> is <code>'0'</code> or <code>'1'</code>.</li>
</ul>
